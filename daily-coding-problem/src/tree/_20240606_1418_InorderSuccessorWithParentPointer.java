     * current == parent.right
     * -----------------------
     * The condition current == parent.right is used to determine
     * whether we need to continue moving up the tree to find the inorder successor.
     * It helps us find the nearest ancestor for which the current node is part of its left subtree.
     *
     *        20
     *       /  \
     *     10    30
     *     / \   / \
     *    5  15 25 35
     *
     * Let's find the inorder successor for the node with value 15:
     *
     * Node 15:
     * 1. Node 15 does not have a right subtree.
     * 2. We need to go up to the parent nodes to find the nearest ancestor for which node 15 would be in the left subtree.
     *
     * The steps would be:
     *
     * 1. Node 15's parent is node 10.
     * 2. Node 15 is the right child of node 10, so we need to continue moving up the tree.
     * 3. The parent of node 10 is node 20.
     * 4. Node 10 is the left child of node 20, so node 20 is the inorder successor of node 15.
     * 5. Thus, the inorder successor of node 15 is node 20.
