The Dutch National Flag Algorithm (DNF) is a sorting algorithm
designed to efficiently sort an array or list containing three distinct elements (e.g., 0s, 1s, and 2s)
in linear time (O(n)) with constant space (O(1)).

It was proposed by Edsger Dijkstra and is named after the Dutch flag,
which has three vertical stripes of red, white, and blueâ€”analogous to the three distinct elements being sorted.
